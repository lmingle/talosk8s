The goal of this project is to document how I got Kubernetes running using Talos Linux. This is just a learning experiment and I'm likely to have issues along the way. This sounds easy from all the reading I've done on the topic. First, I'll follow the tutorials to get it running under Docker. Next I'll work on getting it to work with FluxCD, external DNS and persistent storage on a NFS volume or possibly local storage with something like Longhorn. After that I'll move to physical machines. I currently have a pile of machine available like RPi, NUC, Pine64 and old Dell desktops. The initial experiment will be to bootstrap the cluster using the talosctl CLI. Afterwards, I may move on to experiment using PXE boot. All with a goal to have everything automated.

I'd like to learn more about PXE booting and how to setup DHCP option 66 & 67. I've wanted to place OpenWRT on the Linksys WRT3200ACM router that I have and see if I can get machines to PXE boot from there.
